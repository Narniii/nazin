Introduction
----------------------
Hello and welcome fellow Coder!

As part of our interview process we would like you to complete a programming assignment.
Please read the whole description thoroughly, then create a program to solve the problem at hand.

For the solution, we request that you use *JavaScript* (or TypeScript) as a programming language and *React* as your Library.
The application must run and your solution should provide sufficient evidence that it is complete.

Description
---------------
Your challenge is to create a single page application based on the attached design.
The application is a store in which users can add products to his basket or remove them from it.
Dummy data should be fetched form https://run.mocky.io/v3/a8d03157-a077-44db-9746-695e18a7549e through an xhr request.
Your output will be evaluated both technically and aesthetically, so CSS fidelity is important.

Appearance
-------------------
- By running the application, we must see the store page just like `store.psd` with same colors, alignment, sizing, and shading.
- Needs to be responsive and easy-to-use on every device.
- For styling you must use one of CSS Pre-Processors (preferly SCSS).

Interaction
-------------------
- Users should be able to add a product to their cart by clicking on plus button in every product card or remove it by clicking on minus one.
- Total count and total price of the cart must dynamically change based on user interaction while adding/removing products.

Bonus (Not Required!)
-------------------------------
Below are extra features you do NOT have to implement. If you do have the time, try to implement some of these for bonus points!
- Show loading spinner while waiting for ajax response.
- Display product cards sequentially with transition after the ajax call is finished.
- Show cart items in a modal when the blue button at bottom of page is clicked. Feel free to be creative!
